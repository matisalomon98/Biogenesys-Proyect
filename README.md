# 🌎 **Strategic Expansion of Biogenesys with Python**

## 📑 **Project Overview**
This project focuses on supporting **Biogenesys**, a pharmaceutical company, in identifying optimal locations for laboratory expansion in Latin America. The analysis targets countries such as **Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico**, based on COVID-19 incidence rates, vaccination coverage, and healthcare infrastructure availability. The objective is to enhance responsiveness during pandemics and improve vaccine accessibility.

## 🚀 **Key Project Phases**

### 📂 **Data Preparation & Cleaning**
- Filtered data for relevant countries and date ranges.
- Removed null values and irrelevant columns.
- Standardized data types for consistency.
- Generated summary statistics using Python functions.

### 📊 **Data Exploration & Visualization**
- Conducted statistical analysis and correlation studies.
- Created custom visualizations, including:
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Scatter plots (e.g., temperature vs. confirmed cases)
  - Histograms and boxplots
  - Violin plots for distribution insights
  - Stacked bar charts (e.g., gender-based mortality rates)
- Time series analysis to identify seasonal trends and autocorrelation patterns.

### 📈 **Interactive Dashboard Development**
- Integrated Python-generated visualizations into Power BI.
- Developed an intuitive dashboard with:
  - Monthly COVID-19 case trends
  - Vaccination strategy comparisons
  - Demographic characteristics and health conditions per country
  - Climatic impacts on COVID-19 spread

---

## 🔍 **Insights & Key Findings**
- **Brazil**: Highest priority for expansion due to the largest population, highest confirmed cases, and mortality rates.
- **Mexico**: Second-highest priority based on mortality rates and dense population despite high vaccination levels.
- **Chile**: Best vaccination strategy but remains significant due to public health performance.
- **Temperature Correlation**: Higher temperatures linked to increased COVID-19 cases and mortality rates.
- **Health Conditions Impact**: Pollution identified as the leading cause of mortality in most analyzed countries.

---

## 🌟 **Conclusions & Recommendations**
1. **High Priority Regions:** Brazil and Mexico, given their high population, mortality rates, and economic factors.
2. **Medium Priority Regions:** Argentina and Colombia, considering mortality rates and infrastructure readiness.
3. **Low Priority Regions:** Peru and Chile, based on effective vaccination strategies and lower case numbers.

The analysis highlights the need for tailored expansion strategies, considering socio-economic and health factors unique to each country.

## 💡 **Future Work**
- Incorporate real-time data updates for continuous monitoring.
- Apply machine learning models to forecast future pandemic scenarios.
- Expand the analysis to additional Latin American countries for broader insights.
